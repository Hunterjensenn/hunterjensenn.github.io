### Key Features
**Closed-Loop Control**: Developed a **PWM control loop** in **C** using an ADC polling approach for potentiometer input and DAC output to drive a **4N35 optocoupler**, dynamically modulating the timer's frequency.

**High-Precision Measurement**: Implemented frequency calculation logic utilizing microcontroller interrupts to count clock cycles between signal edges.

**User Interface**: Integrated an **SSD1306 OLED display** via **SPI** to provide real-time visual feedback of measured frequency and potentiometer resistance.
