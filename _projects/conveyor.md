[cite_start]An ongoing project developing a color-based sorting mechanism for industrial simulation[cite: 4698, 4700].

# Implementation
* [cite_start]**Firmware**: Written **strictly in C** to ensure real-time performance and direct register-level hardware control on the **ATmega2560**[cite: 4701, 4702].
* [cite_start]**Hardware Interfacing**: Developed custom drivers for optical sensors to detect object characteristics and implemented logic to coordinate motor actuator timing for precise sorting[cite: 4702].
