Built a standalone signal processing station using a **Raspberry Pi 5** and **RTL-SDR** hardware to decode and visualize various radio frequencies.

### Technical Implementation
**Aircraft Tracking**: Configured **tar1090** to track live Mode S aircraft signals, cross-verifying spatial data against FlightRadar24.

**IoT Data Interpretation**: Utilized **rtl_433** to intercept and decode data packets from local environmental sensors, capturing real-time humidity and temperature readings.

**Remote Management**: Established a headless operating environment using **Tailscale VPN** and **RealVNC**, allowing for secure remote monitoring.
